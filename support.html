		<h1>Support Net Neutrality</h1>
		<p>Although the 'save the net' day has already passed, you can still help protect the free internet. The FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, continues to oppose title II and net neutrality, and will soon again try to push forward legislation to dismantle it. ISPs have already spent billions lobbying to destroy the free internet, and if they are successful the political fight to reclaim it will be far more difficult than to protect it.</p>
		<p>It is now more important than ever to make your voice heard and to protect the internet, as the FCC has called for a vote to repeal net neutrality on december 15th. If their plan passes then the internet as we know it will be changed forever. Take action now!</p>
